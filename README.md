# sql-optimization
- This repository takes a look at SQL queries on a University Case Study. 

- Optimizations were made if necessary. 

- This project was completed using MySQL, so the **Query Execution Plans** being optimized were created by MySQL's optimizer.

### Notable Improvement
The most notable improvement was for Question 5 where I was able to:
- Reduce the number of Rows being examined from 6600 to 600
- Reduced the Query Execution Time by 1 decimanl place (.0052 to .00078)
